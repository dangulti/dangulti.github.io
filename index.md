Welcome! I am a visiting assistant professor at Colgate University department of Economics. I am broadly interested in applying frontier econometric models to interesting economic problems. My job market paper analyzes earning dynamics and household consumption insurance, i.e., the fraction of income shocks households self-insure against. 

My current research focuses on analyzing income and consumption dynamics and examines the link between income and consumption inequality. Another interesting exercise is analyzing how this link varies across different demographic characteristics. Dimensions of heterogeneity can come in the form of various demographic characteristics including age, level of education, race, sex, etc. 

To address questions, I rely on techniques from classical econometrics, structural modeling and cutting-edge machine learning techniques as needed.
