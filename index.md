Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Economics](https://krannert.purdue.edu/academics/Economics/) at Purdue University. My research interest is applying non-stationary time series models in macroeconomics. My job market paper analyzes earning dynamics and household consumption insurance, i.e., the fraction of income shocks households self-insure against. I will be on the job market in 2022-23 and I will be available for interviews at the AEA meetings January 5-8, New Orleans, Louisiana. 

#### JMP Title: Modeling Earnings Processes and Consumption Insurance at the Household Level
##### Abstract
The study of income and consumption linkage and analysis of permanent and transitory income shocks is limited by availability of data. To deal with data sparsity, I propose identifying the partial consumption insurance and income and consumption volatility heterogeneities at the household level using Least Absolute shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). Using PSID data, I estimate partial consumption insurance against permanent shock of 63% and 49% for white and black household heads, respectively; the white and black household heads self-insure against 100% and 90% of the transitory income shocks, respectively. Moreover, I find income and consumption volatilities and partial consumption insurance parameters vary across time.
