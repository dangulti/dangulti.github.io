Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Economics](https://krannert.purdue.edu/academics/Economics/) at Purdue University. My research interest is applying non-stationary time series models in macroeconomics. My job market paper analyzes household consumption insurance, i.e., the fraction of income shocks that passes through to consumption. I will be on the job market in 2022-23 and I will be available for interviews at the AEA meetings January 5-8, New Orleans, Louisiana. 

Before coming to Purdue, I graduated from Columbia University with a Masters degree in [Advanced Economic and Policy Analysis](https://www.columbia.edu/). I received my BA degree from Hawassa University in Ethiopia in [Economics](https://www.hu.edu.et/). I have also worked as a data scientist at [Byteflow Dynamics](https://www.byteflows.com/) and Research Analyst at [Ethiopian Agricultural Transformation Agency](https://www.ata.gov.et/). 

In my spare time I love playing and watching soccer and basketball. I also enjoy other out door activities like hiking and hanging out with friends.
