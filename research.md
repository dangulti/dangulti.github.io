### Working Papers:

#### Modeling Earning Process and Analyzing Household Consumption Insurance
##### [Current Version](../assets/docs/Daniel_jmp.pdf)

The study of income and consumption linkage and analysis of permanent and transitory income shocks is limited by availability of data. To deal with data sparsity, I propose identifying the partial consumption insurance and income and consumption volatility heterogeneities at the household level using Least Absolute shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). Using PSID data, I estimate partial consumption insurance against permanent shock of 63% and 49% for white and black household heads, respectively; the white and black household heads self-insure against 100% and 90% of the transitory income shocks, respectively. Moreover, I find income and consumption volatilities and partial consumption insurance parameters vary across time.

#### Testing Smooth Structural Breaks in Predictive Regression
##### [Current Version](../assets/docs/SmoothBreaks.pdf)

We consider smooth structural break test proposed by Chen and Hong (2012), in a predictive regression setting. The regressors are characterized using the local to non-stationarity framework. We conducted a Monte Carlo experiment to evaluate the finite sample performance of the test statistic and an empirical example is examined to demonstrate the practical application of the proposed test statistic. The Monte Carlo simulations show that the proposed test statistic has better or as good power and size when compared to the popular SupF and LM. Empirically, compared to SupF and LM, the proposed test statistic rejects the null hypothesis of no structural break more frequently when there actually is a structural break present in the data.
